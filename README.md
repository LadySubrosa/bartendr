## Introduction

The prompt for this project was to design and build a landing page for the PPC term "Bartending Certification". The page is intended to get the user to sign up for one or more of the courses offered by the platform the landing page advertises. I wanted to make sure to consider marketing needs, so I spent the first half of the sprint focused on research and design. 

After the visual design and the MVP-level of interaction were planned, I moved on to building the project with Vue.js, which I'm a bit new to. While I considered building the page with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, I have been hearing great things about Vue.js and thought it would be a powerful tool for this particular project. Though there ha been a larning curve, Vue.js helped me bring some of the functionality to life with slightly less work than expected. Yay!

Ultimately, I would recommend incorporating some aspect of testing as a next step. Landing pages like this are great use cases for trying different CTA copy (in fact, I considered a different tone of voice entierly earlier on) or even varied content. As always: iterate, iterate, iterate!

## Research

The research for this project was two-fold: Learning more about best landing page practices and getting an understanding of the user for this particular project. 

I read several articles and looked at a ton of awesome examples of landing pages. Most of this research 

The world of Bartending was a bit of an enigma to me before embarking on this projct. 

User Cetnered Design Chart really helped me organize my thoughts and figure out where I wanted my skethes to go.

## Sketching

During the sketching phase I tried out a lot of different approaches, including a few that I still hope to explore later on.


## Design

After getting a handle on the direction my sketches were taking, I took to the Sketch app on my computer to put it all on the screen. Visual design ended up simplifying a bit, and some of the elements ended up getting desgined while coding with respect to time.


## Build

While I spent a good chunk of time focused on research and design, I still had the itch to try a new framework as opposed to building something vanilla. From what I had learned about Vue.js at that point, it seemed like it could be a powerful framework to integrate more complicated functionality with down the line. It also runs really quickly, which is rad


## Next Steps

Every project benefits from user testing, as well, so that would be one of my next key recommendations. 

Adding more features down the line


## Conclusion

I learned quite a bit during this project that I will take-away with me for future work.
